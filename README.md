# MPSNet: A light-weight deep learning-based network specialized for mobile phones to extract palm-vein features from the saturation channel
by Shi-Jinn Horng, Thi-Van Nguyen, Dinh-Trung Vu, Wanlei Zhou, and Chin-Teng Lin. <strong>The source code of MPSNet will be updated.</strong>
## Introduction
This repository gives the implementation of our proposed palm ROI extraction method based on key vectors and features extraction method based on deep learning.
## Databases
We use 4 public palm-vein databases(Tongji, PolyU, CASIA, XJTU-UP) and two our self-collected databases (NTUST-HP and NTUST-IP) for training and testing MPSNet, see the table below for more details.

<strong>* Researchers requesting our databases should follow the [ANNEX-A terms for use of database](https://github.com/trungvdhp/mobile_palm_recognition_mpsnet/blob/main/ANNEX_A_terms_for_use_of_database.docx) and [Database release agreement](https://github.com/trungvdhp/mobile_palm_recognition_mpsnet/blob/main/Database_release_agreement.docx) file.</strong>

Here are some samples with different hand poses, backgrounds, and lightings from our databases:

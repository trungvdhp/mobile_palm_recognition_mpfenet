# Privacy Policy

TonyAI built the PalmID app as a Free app. This app is provided by TonyAI at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.

## Information Collection and Use

This app needs to use the Camera on your smartphone to take a photo of your hand and then identify your ID based on palm-vein.

The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. 

I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2024-01-25
